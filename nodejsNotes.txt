when we write 
console.log("hello node js")
it will print us => hello node js
but not written any value so after print it say undefined


imp console.log() is not JavaScript part it is mechanism provided by web browsers.

*** fundamentals of nodejs ***
we can't use import export in nodejs like JavaScript.
we have to use 
    module.export={ x:12,y:20}
and than object to export, 
for import use
    const app = require('./app')


filter=>  used for array
const arr = [2,3,4,5]
ket result = arr.filter((item) =>{
    return item<=3;
})



*** global and core module ***

core module we have to add manual
global module don't need to add like console


*** package.json ***
it keeps details about code like path,version,auth,if we add some extra package like nodemon then it keep details of it.

to create it just write "npm init"

what if we delete the nodejs module folder?
if we delete the nodejs module folder then no problem we can download it by npm install then it will give all required dependency in package.json
we don't need to push the nodejs module folder on github.
just write node_modules folder name in .gitignore file.
